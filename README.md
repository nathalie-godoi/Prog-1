# Programação 1 (CI1001) - UFPR

This repository contains all the projects developed during the **CI1001 - Programming 1** course, provided by the Department of Informatics (DINF) at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR).

## About the Course
The course focuses on developing solutions using the **C Language**, focusing on code efficiency, memory management, and best programming practices within a Linux/Unix environment.

### Topics Covered:
* **C Language:** Programming following the C99 standard.
* **ADTs:** Development of Abstract Data Types and code modularization.
* **Memory:** Intensive use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
* **Tooling:** Automation and debugging using `make`, `gcc`, and `valgrind`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into technical evolution exercises (TPs) and a final project:

### Practical Assignments (TP1 to TP5)
Small-to-medium scale exercises that gradually increase in complexity, covering:
* Vector and matrix manipulation.
* Creation of a Rational Numbers ADT (using `structs`).
* Implementation of functions with pass-by-reference.
* Introduction to dynamic allocation.

### Final Project (The Boys)
A project consisting of a **Event Simulation**. The system integrates all course concepts through:
* Dynamic memory management.
* Implementation and management of complex data structures: **linked lists**, **queues (FIFO)**, and **priority queues**.
* Simulation logic based on time-stamped events.

## Requirements and Execution
To compile and run the projects, a Linux environment with the `gcc` compiler is required.
